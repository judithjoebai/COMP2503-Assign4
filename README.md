# COMP2503-Assign4

Using hash map and tree map seemed confusing at first but once I understood the data structures visually, it was much easier to implement. Throughout the project, I had to check my code to see where the hash map needed to be used and where the tree maps needed to be used. The iterators were also quite confusing to use, whether using .hasNext(), getKey(), or getValue() was appropriate for the methods. Overall, after going through multiple ways of writing code, lots of trial and error and quite a bit of research on the data structures, I could compile running code. Considering a lot of the calls were built-in, I realized once you get the hang of it, it is less tedious than the other data structures we've used. I tested my code using the inputs and outputs provided and was able to fix my errors. As far as I know, there are no errors in the code I am submitting,
