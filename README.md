# COMP2503-Assign4

Using has map and tree map seemed to be confusing at first but once understanding the data structures visually, it was much easier to implement. Throughout the project I had to check my code to see where the hash map needs to be used and where the tree maps need to be used. The iterators were also quite confusing to use, whether using .hasNext() or getKey() or getValue() was appropriate for the methods. 

Overall, once going through multiple ways of writing code, lots of trial and error and quite a bit of research on the data structures, I was able to compile running code. Considering a lot of the calls were builtin, I realized once you get the hang of it, it is less tedious than the other data structures we've used. I tested my code using the inputs and outputs provided and was able to fix my errors. As far as I know there are no errors in the code I am submitting,
